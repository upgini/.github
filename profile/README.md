# 🔍 [Upgini](https://upgini.com): Low-code Feature search and enrichment library for machine learning  
Upgini automatically searches through thousands of **ready-to-use features** from [public and community data sources](https://upgini.com/#data_sources)  
and enriches your dataset with new external features in minutes

### 🚀 Awesome features of [Upgini Python Library](https://github.com/upgini/upgini)
⭐️ Automatically find only features that *give accuracy improvement for ML model*. Not just correlated with target variable    
⭐️ Calculate *accuracy metrics and uplifts* if you'll enrich your existing ML model with found external features   
⭐️ Check the stability of accuracy gain from external data on out-of-time intervals and verification datasets. Mitigate risks of unstable external data dependencies in ML pipelines   
⭐️ Curated and updated data sources, including public datasets and community shared data   
⭐️ Support for several search key types (including <i>**date/datetime, country, postal/ZIP code, SHA256 hashed email, IPv4, phone**</i>), more to come...
