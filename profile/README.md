Easily find and add **relevant features** to your ML pipeline from [hundreds of public, community and premium external data sources](https://upgini.com/#data_sources),</br> optimized for ML models with LLMs and other neural networks


## üöÄ Awesome features of [Upgini Python Library](https://github.com/upgini/upgini)
‚≠êÔ∏è Automatically find only relevant features that *give accuracy improvement for ML model*. Not just correlated with target variable  
‚≠êÔ∏è Data source optimizations: automated feature generation with Large Language Models' data augmentation, RNNs, GraphNN; multiple data source ensembling  
‚≠êÔ∏è *Automatic search key augmentation* from all connected sources. If you do not have all search keys in your search request, such as postal/zip code, Upgini will try to add those keys based on the provided set of search keys. This will broaden the search across all available data sources  
‚≠êÔ∏è Calculate *accuracy metrics and uplifts* after enrichment existing ML model with external features  
‚≠êÔ∏è Check the stability of accuracy gain from external data on out-of-time intervals and verification datasets. Mitigate risks of unstable external data dependencies in ML pipeline  
‚≠êÔ∏è Easy to use - single request to enrich training dataset with *all of the keys at once*: [**date/datetime, country, postal/ZIP code, country, phone number, hashed email/HEM, IP-address**](https://github.com/upgini/upgini#-search-key-types-we-support-more-to-come)    
‚≠êÔ∏è [Simple Drag & Drop Search UI:](https://upgini.com/upgini-widget)
