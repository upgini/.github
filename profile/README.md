## 🚀 Awesome features of [Upgini Python Library](https://github.com/upgini/upgini)
⭐️ Automatically find only relevant features that *give accuracy improvement for ML model*. Not just correlated with target variable   
⭐️ Calculate *accuracy metrics and uplifts* if you'll enrich your existing ML model with external features   
⭐️ Check the stability of accuracy gain from external data on out-of-time intervals and verification datasets. Mitigate risks of unstable external data dependencies in ML pipeline   
⭐️ Curated and updated data sources, including public datasets and community-shared data  
⭐️ Easy to use - single request to enrich training dataset with *all of the keys at once*: [**date/datetime, country, postal/ZIP code, country, phone number, hashed email/HEM, IP-address**](https://github.com/upgini/upgini#-search-key-types-we-support-more-to-come)
